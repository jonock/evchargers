# EV Chargers in Basel, Switzerland

The main script gets the datasets from the open data portal of the canton BS (Basel-Stadt, not the other thing)

## Evaluations
Data gets cleaned - differences calculated, cleaned and pushed via the Datawrapper API 
The Charts with the 'dirty' Data are still in the script to demonstrate the 'datacleaning' steps. 

## More information
The Charts are used in this [Blogpost](https://rideable.ch/belegung-ladestationen-iwb-auswertung/) and the data-cleaning is explained further.
